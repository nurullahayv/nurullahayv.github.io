        <h2>The Debate on Women's Suffrage</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p class="drop-cap">A growing movement calling for women's right to vote has been gaining traction in recent months. Proponents argue that women, being equally affected by the laws of the land, should have an equal say in their making...</p>
            <div class="full-content hidden">
                <p>Critics of the movement claim that women lack the education and worldly experience necessary to make informed political decisions. They argue that the fairer sex is better suited to the domestic sphere, leaving matters of governance to their husbands and fathers.</p>
                <p>As the debate rages on, it remains to be seen whether this radical idea will gain enough support to effect real change in our society. Whatever the outcome, it is clear that the question of women's suffrage will continue to be a contentious issue for years to come.</p>
